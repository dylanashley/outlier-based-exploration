abstract="Psychologists distinguish between extrinsically motivated behavior, which is behavior undertaken to achieve some externally supplied reward, such as a prize, a high grade, or a high-paying job, and intrinsically motivated behavior, which is behavior done for its own sake. Is an analogous distinction meaningful for machine learning systems? Can we say of a machine learning system that it is motivated to learn, and if so, is it possible to provide it with an analog of intrinsic motivation? Despite the fact that a formal distinction between extrinsic and intrinsic motivation is elusive, this chapter argues that the answer to both questions is assuredly ``yes'' and that the machine learning framework of reinforcement learning is particularly appropriate for bringing learning together with what in animals one would call motivation. Despite the common perception that a reinforcement learning agent's reward has to be extrinsic because the agent has a distinct input channel for reward signals, reinforcement learning provides a natural framework for incorporating principles of intrinsic motivation.",
